# Neovim-Configuration
My neovim configuration.
To ensure that it functions correctly, please do the following:
* Install the latest stable version of neovim
* Install the latest stable version of `rust-analyzer`
* Ensure the `Lazy` window appeares when the program is first run. If it does not, run the command `:Lazy sync` or `Lazy install`
